# GraphCMS ⨯ NextAuth.js ⨯ Todos ⨯ SWR

[Join our Slack](https://slack.graphcms.com)

This example uses SWR to fetch, and mutate user todos using Next.js API Routes, backed by GraphQL. Users can login using [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org).

Users can login or register using the same form (for the purposes of this demo), and update their profile bio, and set their own todos.

NextAuth.js has a [REST API](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api) you should use to create custom login pages.

## How to Use

You will need to create a Permanent Auth Token to use this example locally.

Inside of `.env` add the following:

```dosini
GRAPHCMS_ENDPOINT=
GRAPHCMS_TOKEN=
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=somethingsupersecret
```

You will need to set `NEXTAUTH_URL` as your actual URL if deploying.

You'll need to create the models `NextAuthUser`, and `Todo` with a relation between them.
